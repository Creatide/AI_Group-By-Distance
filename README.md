Group By Distance (AI Script)
=============================

Adobe Illustrator script to group selected items by distance value. 

> This is test version that I've found my archives and there is no guarantee that it's works perfectly. But go ahead and test it :)

## Install

This is a script. There's no installation needed for using it. 

You can use script by dropping script file over Illustrator.

Or select `"File" > "Scripts" > "Other Scripts..."` and select script file.

## How to Use

#### Features
| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Distance | The range of search area for single item to find other item to make group. |
| Expand Items | Call same funtion as you find from `"Object" > "Expand..."` to make expanded items. |
| Separate Layers | This makes own group for every new groups, otherwise they will be nested on the same group. |

> If you trying to run this script for huge amount of items it'll warn you about this. It could be take quite long time or crash your process, so remember to save your file before running this script for many items. You've been warned!

## About
This is old little script that I've found from my script development archives. This was made for testing purposes. Maybe it's useful someone Illustrator user out there or good start point to build better tool for designers.
